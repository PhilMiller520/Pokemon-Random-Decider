# Pokemon-Random-Decider

The program will consist of three challenge modes:
  1. Solo challenge:
  2. Ironmon challenge
  3. Kaizo challenge

Solo and Ironmon will have their own buttons that when pressed will do the following:
  1. Solo challenge:
    1. it will choose a pokemon game at random and display the game title
    2. it will then choose a pokemon at random from that game and display it
  2. Ironmon challenge:
    1. it will choose a pokemon game at random and display the game title
    2. it will then decide which pokeball the starter will be in.
    3. it will then pick, at minimum, 3 alternative starers the player can choose from (should they be picked in the randomized rom as starters, this is a sperate program that I have not made)
  3. Kaizo challenge:
    1. as the process for choosing a starter in a Kaizo challenge is the same as an Ironmon a check box will be created to change the text in the Ironmon box to state that its now a Kaizo challenge
Images of the box art for the game and pokemon chosen will be displayed

As of 4/17/2023 the buttons for Solo and Ironmon challenges have been created and their message have been displayed.
the check box for Kaizo and the pictures will be added soonish
At this time only pokemon generations 1 through 4 are covered.

as of 4/18/2023 the checkbox button has been added and the pokedexs for gens 1 through 4 have been completed. Also adjusted the placement of the labels and buttons
